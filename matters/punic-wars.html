	<TT><h1>A Small Summary Of The Punic Wars</h1></TT>
	<TT>The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought by <br>Rome and Carthage between 264 BCE and 146 BCE. The wars were named after the Latin word for Phoenician, “Punicus,” as Carthage<br> was a Phoenician colony. The wars were fought over control of trade routes and territories in the western Mediterranean.<br> The First Punic War (264-241 BCE) was fought over control of Sicily. The Second Punic War (218-201 BCE) was fought <br>over control of Spain. The Third Punic War (149-146 BCE) was fought over Carthage’s growing power in Africa. Rome emerged victorious <br>in all three wars, and Carthage was destroyed in 146 BCE.<br></TT>

	<TT style="color: red">The Roman republic was a small and relatively new republic.<br> but... in the italian peninsula it started out as a small city state and started playing the game of war like mittens(the chess bot)<br> destroying all but the best of chess players and stockfish18<br></TT>

	<article><TT style="color: blue"><h2>A bit of background for carthage<br></h2>
	Carthage was founded by Phoenician settlers from the city of Tyre,<br> who brought with them the city-god Melqart . By the end of the 7th century BC, Carthage was becoming one of the leading <br>commercial centers of the West Mediterranean region 1. After a long conflict with the emerging Roman Republic, known as the<br> Punic Wars what we are discussing now(264–146 BC), Rome finally destroyed Carthage in 146 BC . So was carthage another<br> victim of the mittens-like rome???<a  style="color: navy blue">No!!!!(well they got defeated but thet put up a great <br>fight) thy fought back till the fighting reached carthage<br> it self but the romans lost there and the carthage was <br>saved (for now) because this is the fist punic war.<br></a></TT></article>

	<a>Was there part 2?</a><br>
		<br><TT><h1>The second punic wars</h1></TT><br>
	<TT>Certainly! The Second Punic War was fought<br> between Carthage and Rome between 218 and 201 BCE . The war involved confrontations in Spain, Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and North Africa<br> . Hannibal led the Carthaginians, one of the most gifted commanders in history . He is known for his strategic genius and his crossing of<br> the Alps with his army to invade Italy . However, the Romans had their own great general Scipio Africanus, who ultimately defeated Hannibal<br> at the Battle of Zama in 202 BCE .</TT><br>
	<h2>What was Hannibal's strategy?</h2><br>
	<TT>Hannibal’s strategy during the Second Punic War<br> was to invade Italy by crossing the Alps with his army . He hoped to gain allies among Rome’s Latin allies and other Italic peoples who<br> were unhappy with Roman rule . Hannibal won several battles against Rome, but he was ultimately defeated by Scipio Africanus at the <br>Battle of Zama in 202 BCE .</TT>
	<a>Not even Hannibal or his dad hamilcar can<br> escape the military mitten juggernaut of rome.<a><br>
